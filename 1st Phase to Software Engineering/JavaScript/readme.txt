🧪 PRACTICE PROJECT (MANDATORY – 3 HOURS)
🎯 Project: Todo List App (Vanilla JS)
Features (MUST HAVE):

Add todo
Delete todo
Mark as complete
Use event listeners
Use array to store todos

Rules:

❌ No frameworks
❌ No localStorage today
✅ Clean functions
✅ Meaningful variable names

🧠 LEARNING TECHNIQUE (CRITICAL)

🔁 Think → Code → Explain

After writing each function:
“What problem does this solve?”
If you can’t explain it, you don’t know it yet.

✅ Day-2 Completion Checklist

You can mark JavaScript = Completed ONLY if:
You can write a function without Googling syntax
You understand addEventListener
You know what the DOM is
You built the Todo app yourself

🔥 If You Finish Early (Optional)

Add edit todo
Add filter (all / completed)
