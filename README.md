# Full Stack Software Engineering Training

This repository documents my structured learning and hands-on practice as I work toward becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer.
The training is divided into phases, each focusing on a specific area of software engineering and completed through real-world implementation, projects, and experimentation.

## Prerequisites:
This training is designed for someone who already has a basic understanding of core computer science foundations, including:
- Programming Fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic Data Structures & Algorithms


These topics are not covered from scratch in this repository and are assumed to be prior knowledge before starting the phases.
> Note:  I started this training directly from the Frontend Development phase, without a separate foundations phase.
